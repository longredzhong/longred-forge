# longred-forge

Personal conda package repository built with [rattler-build](https://github.com/prefix-dev/rattler-build), inspired by [brad-jones/brads-forge](https://github.com/brad-jones/brads-forge).

This repository automatically builds and publishes conda packages to [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev/channels/longred-forge), making them easily installable via conda/mamba.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**New to longred-forge?** Check out the [Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md) for installation and usage instructions.

## 📦 Available Packages

### hatchet-cli

The Hatchet CLI for managing workflows and background tasks. Hatchet is an open-source platform for running background tasks and durable workflows at scale.

**Installation:**

```bash
# Using pixi
pixi global install -c conda-forge -c https://prefix.dev/longred-forge hatchet-cli

# Using mamba/conda
mamba install -c conda-forge -c https://prefix.dev/longred-forge hatchet-cli
```

**Upstream:** [hatchet-dev/hatchet](https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Automated Release Tracking**: GitHub Actions runs daily to check for new releases from upstream projects
2. **Recipe Updates**: When a new version is detected, the recipe is automatically updated
3. **Multi-Platform Builds**: Packages are built for Linux (x86_64), macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
4. **Publishing**: Built packages are automatically uploaded to the `longred-forge` channel on prefix.dev

## 🛠️ Technical Details

This repository uses:

- **rattler-build**: Fast, modern conda package builder
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline
- **prefix.dev**: Package hosting and distribution
